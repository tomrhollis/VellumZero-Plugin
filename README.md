# VellumZero-Plugin
A plugin for Vellum 1.3+ to take advantage of ElementZero capabilities

Vellum is working on a move to a plugin model, which would allow me to get my hands out of the main code and concentrate on the ElementZero functionality.  It also lets me create my own repository instead of working in a fork.  When Vellum 1.3 releases, this will become the home of all my ElementZero work with Vellum and the other repository will be reset as a normal fork of vellum for my contributions to their code.
